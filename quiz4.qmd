## Question: Multistate Model for Liver Disease Progression (5 points)

In a study of patients with chronic liver disease, individuals are initially diagnosed with **compensated cirrhosis**, meaning that their liver function is impaired but they have not yet developed major symptoms. Over time, some patients experience disease progression adnd develop **decompensated cirrhosis**, characterized by clinical events such as ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy. At any point, patients may become eligible for a **liver transplant**, either directly from the compensated stage or after decompensation. Finally, patients may **die** after they develop decompensated cirrhosis — either without ever receiving a transplant, or after undergoing a transplant.

### (a) (5 points)

Draw a multistate diagram showing the four patient states — compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant, and death — and all possible transitions among them.

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=3cm and 13cm, >=Stealth]
\node[rectangle, draw, thick,  minimum width=1.5cm, minimum height=0.9cm, align=center] (0) {0: Compensated};
\node[right of=0] (05) {};
\node[rectangle, draw, thick,  minimum width=1.5cm, minimum height=0.9cm, align=center,  above of=05] (1) {1: Decompensated};
\node[rectangle, draw, thick,  minimum width=1.5cm, minimum height=0.9cm, align=center,  below of=05] (2) {2: Transplant};
\node[rectangle, draw, thick,  minimum width=1.5cm, minimum height=0.9cm, align=center, right of=05] (3) {3: Death};

\draw[->, thick] (0) -- (1);
\draw[->, thick] (0) -- (2);
\draw[->, thick] (1) -- (2);
\draw[->, thick] (1) -- (3);
\draw[->, thick] (2) -- (3);
\end{tikzpicture}

### (b) (5 points)

Answer the following questions:

1.  Which state(s) are absorbing? Briefly explain your reasoning.

**State 3 (Death)** is absorbing because, once a patient dies, no further transitions can occur.

2.  Would a *Markov* or a *semi-Markov* model be more appropriate for describing the risk of death *after* liver transplantation? Explain their differences.

A **semi-Markov model** is more appropriate for the transition from transplant to death. The risk of death depends on the **time since transplant**, not just the current state.
