## **Instructions**

-   You have **10 minutes** to complete this quiz.
-   Answer all questions *concisely*.
-   Show all relevant calculations where applicable.

## **Question 1 (5 points) – Left-Truncated Data**

The table below presents left-truncated survival data for **6 individuals** in a study.

| Entry Time $T_L$ | Event/Censoring Time $X$ | Event Indicator $\delta$ (1: event; 0: censoring) |
|:----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
|        0         |      2.2       |            1             |
|       1.5        |      3.8       |            0             |
|       1.8        |      4.1       |            1             |
|       3.0        |      6.3       |            0             |
|       3.5        |      7.0       |            1             |
|       5.0        |      8.0       |            1             |

-   Compute the Kaplan-Meier estimator $\hat{S}(t)$ at times $t = 2, 4, 6.5$, and $8$. (Expressions are sufficient; no need to compute numerical values.)

## **Question 2 (5 points) – Time-Varying Treatment Effect in Cox Model**

Consider a Cox proportional hazards model: \begin{equation}\label{eq:cox}
\lambda(t \mid Z) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\beta Z),
\end{equation} where $Z$ is a binary treatment indicator ($Z = 1$ for treatment, $Z = 0$ for control).

Now suppose the log-hazard ratio is not constant over time, but follows a **quadratic function**: $$
\text{HR}(t) = \frac{\lambda(t \mid Z=1)}{\lambda(t \mid Z=0)} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 t + \gamma_2 t^2.
$$

-   To specify the above form of HR$(t)$, add time-varying covariates in model \eqref{eq:cox} that are interactions between $Z$ and certain functions of time.
