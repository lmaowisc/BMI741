## **Instructions**

-   You have **10 minutes** to complete this quiz.
-   Answer all questions *concisely*.
-   Show all relevant setup and multiplication steps, but **you do not need to compute final decimal values**.

## Question 1

A cardiology team is studying **time to hospital readmission (months)** after discharge for acute heart failure.

-   Event = readmission\
-   Censored = end of follow-up without readmission

Ten patients are followed for up to 12 months.

| Patient | Follow-up time (months) | Event? (1 = yes, 0 = censored) |
|--------:|------------------------:|-------------------------------:|
|       1 |                     1.5 |                              1 |
|       2 |                     2.0 |                              1 |
|       3 |                     3.5 |                              0 |
|       4 |                     4.0 |                              1 |
|       5 |                     5.0 |                              1 |
|       6 |                     6.5 |                              0 |
|       7 |                     7.0 |                              1 |
|       8 |                     8.0 |                              1 |
|       9 |                    10.0 |                              0 |
|      10 |                    10.5 |                              1 |

### (a) Construct the risk-set table

1.  List the distinct event times ($t_j$).
2.  At each event time, compute:
    -   Number at risk at that time ($n_j$).
    -   Number of events at that time ($d_j$).
    -   The discrete hazard = ($d_j/n_j$).

Present your work in a table.

### (b) Kaplan–Meier estimates

Using the product-limit method:

1.  Compute the Kaplan–Meier estimate at **5 months**.
2.  Compute the Kaplan–Meier estimate at **8 months**.

Show each multiplication step clearly.

### (c) Interpretation

Based on your result in part (b), what percentage of patients remain free of readmission at 8 months?

## **Question 2**

You fit a **Kaplan-Meier estimator** to a dataset and obtain the following estimated survival probabilities at two time points: $$
\hat{S}(3) = 0.80, \quad \hat{S}(5) = 0.65.
$$ For a subject who has already survived to 3 (years), what is their probability of surviving to 5 (years)?
