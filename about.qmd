### Overview

This course surveys modern statistical methods for analyzing **censored** time-to-event data arising in clinical, epidemiological, sociological, and engineering studies. We emphasize intuitive explanations of statistical theory, such as counting-process martingales, to address real-world problems and develop practical problem-solving skills. The course combines methodological exposition with extensive case studies, primarily drawn from the health sciences. Sample R and SAS code will be provided throughout.

The primary focus is on the **application** of statistical methods to data analysis and study design, with careful attention to interpretation and assumptions.

### Course Structure

The course consists of three parts. The first part covers methods for univariate event times, including the Kaplan–Meier estimator, log-rank tests, and the Cox proportional hazards model. The second part extends these ideas to more complex outcomes, such as recurrent events, multivariate events, (semi-)competing risks, joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data, multistate processes, and composite endpoints. The third part introduces selected modern topics, including causal inference and machine learning for censored data.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to

-   Understand the defining features of censored data and their implications for statistical inference
-   Select appropriate nonparametric and semiparametric methods for different types of time-to-event data
-   Evaluate and assess modeling assumptions for estimation and inference
-   Apply statistical procedures to real-world problems using R (or SAS)
-   Clearly interpret and communicate analytical results in response to substantive scientific questions

### Prerequisites

Students should have foundational knowledge of random variables, expectation, variance, and maximum likelihood estimation, as well as introductory coursework in hypothesis testing (e.g., *t*-tests and ANOVA) and (generalized) linear regression models. Prior experience with R or SAS is helpful but not required.
