The **Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)** trial was conducted from **1999 to 2012** to evaluate the health effects of specific strategies for managing blood glucose levels, serum lipid levels, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. Here, we focus on the glycemia substudy, which investigated whether **intensive glycemic control** slows **progression of diabetic retinopathy** compared to standard control.  

Diabetic retinopathy is a major **microvascular complication of diabetes** and a leading cause of blindness in the U.S. The study enrolled **10,251 diabetic patients**, with **5,128 randomized** to intensive control and **5,123 to standard control**, followed over **7 years** for indications of **retinopathy progression** (e.g., loss of vision, cataract extraction, vitrectomy, etc.).  

Our primary research question is:  
- *Does intensive glycemic control reduce the risk of retinopathy progression compared to standard glycemic control?*  

Also of interest are risk factors such as **age, sex, race, medical history, and clinical measurements like HbA1c**.

### **Data Description**
The dataset **`accord_glyc.txt`** contains the following variables:

- **MaskID**: Patient identifier  
- **time**: Time (years) from randomization to retinopathy progression or censoring  
- **status**: Event indicator (1 = retinopathy progression, 0 = censored)  
- **trt**: Treatment group (1 = intensive glycemic control, 0 = standard glycemic control)  
- **female**: Sex (1 = female, 0 = male)  
- **age**: Baseline age (years)  
- **race**: Race (White, Black, Hispanic, Other)  
- **hba1c**: Glycosylated hemoglobin (%)  
- **cvd**: History of cardiovascular disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)  
- **chol**: Total cholesterol (mg/dL)  
- **ldl**: Low-density lipoprotein (mg/dL)  
- **hdl**: High-density lipoprotein (mg/dL)

## **Exam Questions**

### **1. Descriptive Statistics (20 points)**
Summarize key baseline characteristics **by treatment group** and **overall**, including:

- Demographic variables: **Sex, age, and race**
- Medical history: **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**
- Biochemical measurements: **HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, etc.**
- **Calculate the event rates** of retinopathy progression in each treatment arm.

---

### **2. Graphical Analysis (20 points)**
To explore treatment effects visually:  

- **Compute and plot Kaplan-Meier survival curves** for retinopathy progression-free probabilities, stratified by:  
  - **Treatment group**
  - **Sex**
  - **Race**  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Which **sex and race group** appears to benefit most from intensive glycemic control?

---

### **3. Multiple Regression Analysis (40 points)**
Construct a **Cox proportional hazards model** to analyze how intensive glycemic control and other factors affect **retinopathy progression**, adjusting for key covariates.

#### **Steps to Follow:**
1. **Covariate Selection:** Based on results from **Questions 1 & 2**, choose relevant risk factors.  
2. **Proportionality Assumption:**  
   - Check whether each covariate satisfies the **proportional hazards assumption**.  
   - If violated, apply appropriate corrections (e.g., time-dependent covariates, stratification).  
3. **Functional Form of Continuous Covariates:**  
   - Check whether continuous variables (e.g., age, HbA1c) are correctly specified.  
   - Consider transformations (e.g., splines, quadratic terms) if necessary.  
4. **Statistical Inference:**  
   - Interpret the effects of **intensive glycemic control** and **other significant risk factors**.  
   - Perform a formal **global test** for race group differences (degrees of freedom: $3$).  

---

### **4. Reporting Findings (20 points)**
Write a **short press release (3â€“4 sentences)** summarizing the **most important findings** in **nontechnical language**, suitable for a general audience.  

Ensure the summary is:  
- **Concise**  
- **Scientifically accurate**  
- **Understandable to non-experts**
