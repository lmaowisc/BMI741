### Overview

This course surveys modern statistical methods for analyzing **censored** time-to-event data in clinical, epidemiological, sociological, and engineering studies. We provide intuitive explanations of statistical theory, such as counting-process martingale, to address real-world problems and build problem-solving skills. The course combines methodological exposition with extensive case studies, primarily from health sciences research (sample R/SAS code will be provided). The focus is on the **application** of data analysis and study design.

### Course Structure

The course consists of three parts. The first part covers methods for univariate event times, e.g., Kaplan–Meier curve, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model. The second part extends to complex outcomes such as recurrent events, multivariate events, (semi-)competing risks, joint survival and longitudinal data analysis, multistate data, and composite endpoints. The third part explores cutting-edge topics, including causal inference and machine learning for censored data.

### Learning Outcomes

Students will:

-   Understand the features of censored data and their impact on statistical inference.
-   Select appropriate non- and semi-parametric methods for various data types.
-   Evaluate and verify assumptions for estimation and inference.
-   Apply statistical procedures to solve real-world problems using R (or SAS).
-   Clearly interpret and present analytical results to address substantive questions.

### Prerequisites

Students should have foundational knowledge in random variables, expectation, variance, and maximum likelihood estimation, as well as introductory courses in hypothesis testing (e.g., *t*-test, ANOVA) and (generalized) linear regression models. Prior experience with R or SAS is helpful but not required.
