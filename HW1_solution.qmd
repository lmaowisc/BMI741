## Problem 1.2

::: callout-note
## Question

Suppose that patient enrollment (and randomization) is uniform in calendar time $[0, \tau_b]$ and that the study is terminated at calendar time $\tau_c$ $(\tau_c>\tau_b)$. What is the distribution of the administrative censoring time? (Hint: see Fig. 1.2) Further suppose that patients are subject to a random LTFU following an exponential distribution with hazard $\lambda_L$ (whose survival function is $\exp(-\lambda_L t)$). Write out the survival function for the censoring time $C$ (i.e., the earlier of administrative censoring and LTFU times).
:::

The administrative censoring time $C_A$ is defined as the duration between time of enrollment, $R\sim \mbox{Unif}[0, \tau_b]$, and time of study termination $\tau_c$ (see Fig. 1.1). So $$C_A = (\tau_c - R) \sim \mbox{Unif}[\tau_c - \tau_b, \tau_c].$$ As a result, $${\rm pr}(C_A > t) = \left(\frac{\tau_c - t}{\tau_b}\wedge 1\right)_+
=\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
1&  0\leq t \leq \tau_c - \tau_b\\
\frac{\tau_c - t}{\tau_b}& \tau_c - \tau_b < t \leq \tau_c\\
0 & t\geq \tau_c
\end{array}
\right.,
$$ where $x_+=\max(x, 0)$.

On the other hand, the survival function for LTFU $C_L$ is ${\rm pr}(C_L > t) = \exp(-\lambda_L t)$. Assuming $C_A\indep C_L$, the survival function for the overall censoring time $C$ is \begin{align}
{\rm pr}(C > t)&={\rm pr}(C_A\wedge C_L > t)\\
&={\rm pr}(C_A > t){\rm pr}(C_L > t)\\
&=\left(\frac{\tau_c - t}{\tau_b}\wedge 1\right)_+\exp(-\lambda_L t)
\end{align}

## Problem 1.3

::: callout-note
## Question

Show that $S_{\rm imp}(t)\leq S(t)$ for all $t$ whether censoring is independent or not. Give a simple sufficient condition for strict inequality under $C\indep T$.
:::

Because $X=\min(T,C)$, we have that $X\leq T$ always. Therefore, $X>t$ implies $T>t$. Hence $\pr(X>t)\leq \pr(T>t)$. Under independence, we have that $$
S_{\rm imp}(t)=\pr(X>t)=\pr(T>t)\pr(C>t)=S(t)\pr(C>t),
$$ which is strictly less than $S(t)$ if $\pr(C>t)<1$ and $S(t)>0$. That is, if there is a positive probability of censoring before $t$ and a positive probability of failure after it.


## Problem 1.5 (Extra credit)

::: callout-note
## Question
Suppose that $T$ and $C$ are independently distributed exponential random
variables with hazard rates $\lambda$ and $\lambda_C$, respectively.

- Derive $S_{\rm cc}(t)$ in analytic form.
- Compare $S_{\rm cc}(t)$ with the target estimand $S(t)$.
- Comment on the degree of underestimation in terms of the relative
magnitudes of the hazard rates.
:::


Let $T \sim \text{Expn}(\lambda)$ and $C \sim \text{Expn}(\lambda_C)$ be independent, so
$$
S(t) \;=\; \pr(T > t) \;=\; \exp(-\lambda t).
$$

By definition, the complete-case estimand is
$$
S_{\rm cc}(t) \;=\; \pr(T > t \mid T \le C)
\;=\;
\frac{\pr(T > t,\; T \le C)}{\pr(T \le C)}.
$$

Compute the numerator---first fix $T=u$ and then integrate over $f_T(u)$, the density of $T$:
\begin{align*}
\pr(T > t,\; T \le C)
&\;=\;
\int_t^\infty \pr(C \ge u)\, f_T(u)\, \mathrm{d} u \\
&\;=\;
\int_t^\infty \exp(-\lambda_C u)\, \lambda \exp(-\lambda u)\, \mathrm{d} u \\
&\;=\;
\lambda \int_t^\infty \exp\{-(\lambda+\lambda_C)u\}\,\mathrm{d} u \\
&\;=\;
\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\lambda_C}\exp\{-(\lambda+\lambda_C)t\}.
\end{align*}


Compute the denominator:
$$
\pr(T \le C)
=
\int_0^\infty \pr(C \ge u)\, f_T(u)\, \mathrm{d} u
=
\int_0^\infty \exp(-\lambda_C u)\, \lambda \exp(-\lambda u)\, \mathrm{d} u
=
\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\lambda_C}.
$$

Therefore,
$$
S_{\rm cc}(t)
=
\frac{\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\lambda_C}\exp\{-(\lambda+\lambda_C)t\}}
{\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\lambda_C}}
=
\exp\{-(\lambda+\lambda_C)t\}.
$$

To compare $S_{\rm cc}(t)$ with $S(t)$:

$$
S_{\rm cc}(t) \;=\; \exp\{-(\lambda+\lambda_C)t\}
\;=\;
\exp(-\lambda t)\exp(-\lambda_C t)
\;=\;
S(t)\,\exp(-\lambda_C t).
$$

Hence, for any $t>0$ with $\lambda_C>0$, we have $S_{\rm cc}(t) < S(t)$.


Since multiplicative bias factor is $\exp(-\lambda_C t)$, underestimation increases as $\lambda_C$ increases (more censoring pressure) and as $t$ increases. In particular, if $\lambda_C \ll \lambda$, the bias is mild for moderate $t$, whereas if $\lambda_C$ is comparable to or larger than $\lambda$, $S_{\rm cc}(t)$ can be substantially smaller than $S(t)$ even for moderate $t$.

Baseline characteristics appear to be well balanced between the treatment arms, except that the proportion of black participants is slightly higher in the patch-only arm (36%) than in the combination arm (25%). The relapse rates are substantially lower in the combination arm than in the patch-only arm.

## Problem 1.10

::: callout-note
## Question

Summarize the CGD (chronic granulomatous disease) study data described in Example 1.3 by the randomized treatment group in terms of patient baseline characteristics and event rates. Comment on the balance of baseline characteristics between the treatment arms. Also be sure to include the event rates for both

-   the first infection;
-   recurrent infections (including the first).

Organize your results in a table suitable for inclusion as "Table 1" in a medical research paper. (The study dataset is in `cgd.txt`.)
:::

The baseline patient characteristics and events rates for the CGD study are summarized by treatment arm in Table 1 below. Most of the baseline characteristics are well balanced between the randomized arms, except that the proportion of X-linked inheritance is slightly higher in the treatment arm (71.4%) than in the control arm (63.1%). The event rates for both first and recurrent infections are substantially lower in the treatment arm.
